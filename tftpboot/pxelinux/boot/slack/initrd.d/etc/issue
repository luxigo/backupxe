Welcome to the Slackware Linux installation disk! (version 12.1)

######  IMPORTANT!  READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY.  ######

- You will need one or more partitions of type 'Linux' prepared.  It is also
  recommended that you create a swap partition (type 'Linux swap') prior
  to installation.  For more information, run 'setup' and read the help file.

- If you're having problems that you think might be related to low memory (this
  is possible on machines with 64 or less megabytes of system memory), you can
  try activating a swap partition before you run setup.  After making a swap
  partition (type 82) with cfdisk or fdisk, activate it like this: 
    mkswap /dev/<partition> ; swapon /dev/<partition>

- Once you have prepared the disk partitions for Linux, type 'setup' to begin
  the installation process.  

- If you do not have a color monitor, type:  TERM=vt100
  before you start 'setup'.

You may now login as 'root'.
