OK, we will install from a directory within the current
filesystem. If you have mounted this directory yourself,
you should not use /mnt or /var/log/mount as mount points,
since Setup might need to use these directories.  You may
install from any part of the current directory structure,
no matter what the media is (including NFS). You will need
to type in the name of the directory containing the 
subdirectories for each source disk.

Which directory would you like to install from?
