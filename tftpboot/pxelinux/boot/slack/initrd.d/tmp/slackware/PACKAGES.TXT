dhcp: address from this pool, and then use it temporarily for communication
dhcp: on the network.   The DHCP protocol also provides a mechanism whereby
dhcp: a client can learn important details about the network to which it is
dhcp: attached, such as the location of a default router or name server.

xorg-server-xvfb: with this server without the need for real hardware that supports the
xorg-server-xvfb: desired depths.  A secondary use is testing clients against unusual
xorg-server-xvfb: depths and screen configurations.

PACKAGE SIZE (compressed):  56 K
PACKAGE SIZE (uncompressed):  110 K
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
zoo: zoo (archiving and compressing utility)
zoo:
zoo: Zoo is used to create and maintain collections of files in compressed
zoo: form.  It uses a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm that gives space
zoo: savings in the range of 20% to 80% depending on the type of file data.
zoo: Zoo can store and selectively extract multiple generations of the same
zoo: file.  Data can be recovered from damaged archives by skipping the
zoo: damaged portion and locating undamaged data with the help of fiz(1).
