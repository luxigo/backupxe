This used to be a place to make custom tagfiles, but now it's just here as a
"non-standard directory" so that we have a good way to probe if we're running
off the rootdisk and not an installed system.  We need to know this within
pkgtool when it's started up at a prompt so we know to emit some mounting
instructions.
